# stupid-electronics-components

This is a repository of commonly used electronics components. We'll talk about those later.

In the meantime, 'Plumpot' on the Youtubes has some very nice videos on how to use Kicad symbols and footprints. If you make some of your own, feel free to send a pull request or let me know about them.
