# stupid-electronics-components

This is a repository of commonly used electronics component symbols and footprints in KiCAD. We'll talk about those later.

In the meantime, 'Plumpot' on the Youtubes has some very nice videos on how to use Kicad symbols and footprints. 

If you make some of your own, feel free to send a pull request or let me know about them.

# Making Electronics without PCBWay etc

So you go through the process of:

- Prototyping your circuit
- Drawing your schematic in Kicad. 
    - Drawing Symbols
    - Drawing Footprints
    - Importing STEP files
    - PCB Layout
    - Routing Traces
    - Adding logos
    - Generating Gerber files

...And then you can send everything off to a board manufacturer and get 10 boards after a week or so of waiting. I don't know about the reader, but there are a few things about that that don't sit quite right with the author. I don't always want a fully done board. If you're reading this, you're in the business of making prototypes. You may want to make something as simple as a breakout board for new surface mount new chip so you can test it on a breadboard. You may simply not want to have ten of something that has been shipped half way around the planet, when the stuff to make the circuit you want has already been shipped to your local supplier of such [commodities](./electronics-suppliers.md).  

# Safety

## Lets get safety out of the way right now.
This project will involve numerous new and unique ways for you to hurt yourself. I can't list them all here, but do be careful. Wear the required PPE at all times and follow the local Health and Safety rules.

For the contents of this readme, you'll at least need some goggles, ear plugs, nitrile/latex gloves and maybe some work gloves if you feel you need them. It's also your responsibility to try not to burn yourself on a soldering iron, prick your finger on a wire, de-glove your hand with a drill or lode your sight because you didn't wear the goggles. Oh, and don't inhale!

## Prototyping Methods

### Protoboards

Before you go all full blown PCB on your latest project. It may be worth asking if you really need to. Basic prototypes on breadboard, with jumper wires and sphagetti, are temporary by their very nature. While it is recommended that the circuit schematic is recorded at this stage, a more permenant solution is often required. This is where 'proto-board' in all of it's various flavours comes in.

## DIY PCB's

There are a number of methods for producing your own printed circuit board. The main topic of conversation here will be the **selective removal of copper by chemical etching**. However, there are other methods such as metal deposition using conductive inks, even counductive sewing thread!
